# Customize factory and reader

If the built-in factories cannot reach your needs, you can implement your own `factory` and/or `reader`. 

<!-- This requires some knowledge of `ROOT`'s streaming mechanism and `uproot-custom`'s design. -->

```{admonition} Prerequisites

Customizing own `reader` requires C++ compiler supporting `C++17` and `CMake>3.20`.

This chapter describes preliminary knowledge you may need when customizing your own `factory` and `reader`, and a step-by-step guide to create a template Python project for your custom implementation.
